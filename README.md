# Substack Downloader

A tool to **archive** Substack newsletters you are currently subscribed to. This allows you to keep an offline copy of the content you have paid for, forever.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This is NOT a piracy tool.**
> *   It can **only** download content you usually have access to.
> *   It does **not** bypass paywalls for newsletters you are not subscribed to.
> *   Its primary use case is archiving your library before you unsubscribe.

## Privacy & Security

*   **100% Local**: Your cookies, session data, and downloaded articles are stored **only on your computer**. Nothing is ever sent to any external server.
*   **Safe**: Your credentials are used strictly to authenticate with Substack for downloading your own content.

## Features

- **Personal Archive**: Download all posts from a newsletter to your local machine.
- **Paid Content Support**: Authenticates using your existing subscription to archive subscriber-only posts.
- **Custom Domain Support**: Includes a login helper to bypass bot protection on custom domains (e.g., `lennysnewsletter.com`).
- **Offline Assets**: Downloads images locally so you can view posts without an internet connection.
- **Markdown Support**: Converts posts to Markdown (`.md`) with local image links, perfect for Obsidian or Notion.
- **Podcast Skipping**: Option to skip podcast/audio episodes (`--skip-podcasts`).
- **HTML Export**: Saves clean, readable HTML files.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/substack-scraper.git
    cd substack-scraper
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`.

    Re-run `source venv/bin/activate` in each new terminal before using the tool.

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Install Brave Browser:**
    The login helper drives your local [Brave](https://brave.com/) install instead of a bundled Chromium. On macOS the default install path is auto-detected. On Linux/Windows, or if Brave is installed in a non-standard location, set `BRAVE_EXECUTABLE_PATH` in `.env`.

## Authentication

Substack uses complex "bot protection" for some domains. This tool provides a **Login Helper** (`login.py`) to make authentication easy.

### Method A: Standard Substacks (e.g., `name.substack.com`)
For most newsletters, you only need to log in once.

1.  Run in your terminal:
    ```bash
    python login.py
    ```
2.  A Brave window will open. Log in to `substack.com`.
3.  **Go back to the terminal** and press **Enter** to save your session.
4.  This creates `substack_session.json`, which works for **all** standard Substack newsletters.

### Method B: Custom Domains (e.g., `robkhenderson.com`, `lennysnewsletter.com`)
Newsletters with their own domains are isolated "islands" and require their own login.

1.  Run the helper with the URL (all on one line):
    ```bash
    python login.py https://www.lennysnewsletter.com
    ```
2.  A Brave window will open. Log in to that specific site.
3.  **Go back to the terminal** and press **Enter** to save your session.
4.  This saves a domain-specific session (e.g., `substack_session_www.lennysnewsletter.com.json`) which the scraper will automatically detect and use.

## Usage

**Basic Scrape** (HTML + Markdown + Images):
```bash
python scraper.py --url https://read.substack.com
```

**Markdown Only (Best for Obsidian):**
```bash
python scraper.py --url https://read.substack.com --md-only
```

**Skip Podcasts:**
```bash
python scraper.py --url https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com --skip-podcasts
```

**Limit Number of Posts:**
```bash
# Download only the 5 most recent posts
python scraper.py --url https://www.robkhenderson.com --limit 5
```

**Custom Output Location:**
```bash
# Save into a custom location (default is ./archive)
python scraper.py --url https://read.substack.com --output-dir ~/Obsidian/Newsletters
```

## Output

Downloaded posts are saved in the `archive/` directory (configurable with `--output-dir`), organized by domain:

```
archive/
├── read.substack.com/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── image1.jpg
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── 2023-10-01_some-post-title.md
│   └── 2023-10-01_some-post-title.html
└── ...
```
